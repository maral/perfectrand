# perfectrand
The perfect random number generator. Python module demonstration. Hosted also at official [Python package index](pypi.python.org/pypi/perfectrand/0.1).

Made for a presentation at [Maths and Physics faculty of Charles University](http://mff.cuni.cz) in Prague, for a class of Advanced Tools for Software Monitoring and Development - [site in Czech](http://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/teaching/advanced_develmonitor_tools/).

The module was created by a tutorial at [readthedocs.org](https://www.readthedocs.org) called [Python Packaging User Guide](https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), very well written and simple to use.

The whole project was made in about 30 minutes and no errors happened, I can highly recommend using the Python package system.

## Installation
Python 3 required. On Windows you need to have directory C:\path_to_python\Scripts in your PATH \([quick guide here](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)\).
Then simply use `pip install perfectrand` or `easy_install perfectrand`.

## Usage
Run python shell and simply write the following:
```
>>> import perfectrand
>>> perfectrand.randint()
42
>>>
```
